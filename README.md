# Design and Documentation

## Problem definition

Bicycles are a product that people often either own but don't use, or have a brief
need for but do not wish to purchase. Often cities implement large-scale bike-hiring systems
(such as min Melbourne) but in Sydney this has not been done. Tourists especially would
benefit from a large-scale 2-sided marketplace for bike hire.

## Solution

Bikeshare allows people to monetize their unused bikes by listing them for hire online. It
people can browse by location and find a product that suits their need and is within their
price range, and submit a booking. These bookings can then be confirmed by the lister,
and the details negotiated via the inbuilt messagin system.
